# Introduction-to-machine-learning-duke-coursera
These files (datasets and notebooks) were created or used from introduction to machine learning course from coursera (DUKE university).
The course mainly jumped from logistic regression to CNN and NLP. It seems the professors were really interested to teach NLP.
I enjoyed the course although the name is a little general compare to the course material.
